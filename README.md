# Javascript (NodeJS) Code Sample

This sample is constructed using Visual Stuido Code 1.36, so the IDE is required if you want to modify the source and running the application as Console Application. You can also use another IDE, but the project maybe need some conversion before running the sample.

__Note: This sample is constructed with NodeJS framework v10.16.3.__
